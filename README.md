## Summary

GraphQL is a powerful opensource query language developed by Facebook. It solves the problem of building good, intuitive, and well-designed APIs. In the last few years, GraphQL has grown in traction and been adopted by many small and large companies. 

Today we will be building a GraphQL weather app with Node and Typescript. We will start by defining what GraphQL is at a high level and then configuring a GraphQL server using the Apollo Framework. We will use techniques commonly seen in large-scale microservice architectures to wrap around an external Weather API.
